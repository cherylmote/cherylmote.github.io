<h3> Bright and Early Breakfast Time! </h3>
<h4> <i>Egg and Cheese Bagel </i></h4>
<h4 style = "color: red"> You're my everything (bagel) ;) </h4>
<p>One of my favorite breakfasts of all time is an egg and cheese bagel. It's 
definitely not too difficult to make and it's delicious. The small cofffee shop right next to
my house sold these bagel-sandwiches, and one day I decided to try my hand at making
them, myself. </p>
<p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
<dl> 
  <dt> <input type="checkbox"> 1 Bagel</dt>
  <dd> - my favorite choice of bagels 
  for this recipe is everything bagels, but sun-dried tomato bagels are also yummy!  </dd>
  <dt> <input type="checkbox"> 1 egg</dt>
  <dd> - I like to use cage-free farm-fresh eggs</dd>
  <dt> <input type="checkbox"> Shredded mozzarella</dt>
  <dd> - I strongly believe: the more cheese, the better </dd>
  <dt> <input type="checkbox"> Shredded cheddar </dt>
  <dd> - Sharp cheddar is *chef's kiss*</dd>
  <dt> <input type="checkbox"> Spreadable cream cheese </dt>
  <dd> - I really go hard on this ingredient!</dd>
</dl>

<p> I start by toasting my bagel. I break an egg into a microwaveable bowl and scramble it. 
Then, I sprinkle shredded mozzarella and cheddar and stick the bowl in the microwave
for about one minute, until the egg is fully cooked. Time to assemble! I take the toasted
bagel and spread cream cheese (the more generous, the better) on both sides and stick the cooked 
egg in the middle! All done and a delectable breaksfast dish. </p>
